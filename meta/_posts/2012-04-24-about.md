    A brief history of the site so far, with some thoughts and explanations on what it is, <em>why</em> it is, and how it got here.

So, what on earth is going on? I set up [`fernseed.org`][fernseed] in 2008 as a dumping ground; somewhere for me to practice the process of writing by web-publishing short stories. The URL would be known to no-one but myself and the domain name was [a bit of a pun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fern#Folklore).

It was eventually repurposed as a single ongoing experiment in serialised prose fiction with [*The Second Room*][second-room], a semi-regularly updated second-person mystery in the [slipstream](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slipstream_(genre)) genre. More recently, the site has expanded to also encompass thoughts on technology, the process of writing and other randomness.

Updates are written in *Scrivener* using the *Markdown* plain-text syntax and automatically converted to HTML by the *Jekyll* static-website generation tool.{% if site.github %} Since 2014 all content has been version controlled using *git* and hosted by *GitHub Pages*. This means that you'll be able to access the complete [source code]({{ site.github.repository_url }}) for the site along with its [change history]({{site.github.repository_url }}/commits/master), if you so desire.{% endif %} See the [acknowledgements page][thanks] for a full list of the tools and technology in use.
