So, what on earth is going on? [fernseed.org][fernseed] began[^fn1] as a dumping ground; somewhere for me to practice the process of writing by web-publishing short stories. The URL would be known to no-one but myself and the domain name was [a bit of a pun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fern#Folklore). 

It was eventually repurposed as a single ongoing experiment in serialised prose fiction with [*The Second Room*][second-room], a semi-regularly updated second-person mystery in the [slipstream](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slipstream_(genre)) genre.

More recently, the site has expanded to also encompass thoughts on technology, the process of writing and other randomness.

Updates are written in *Scrivener* using the *Markdown* plain-text syntax and automatically converted to HTML by the *Jekyll* static-website generation tool.{% if site.github %} Since 2014 all content has been version controlled using *git* and hosted by *GitHub Pages*. This means that you'll be able to access the complete [source code]({{ site.github.repository_url }}) for the site along with its [change history]({{site.github.repository_url }}/commits/master), if you so desire[^fn2].{% endif %} See the [acknowledgements page][thanks] for a full list of the tools and technology in use. 

The [sidebar][sidebar] acts as a navigation hub for the site and will contain any supplementary content or links for a given post, providing additional context or references.

Cookies are written for anonymous analytics purposes only and you may choose to [opt out](/meta/do-not-track/) of their collection[^fn3]. 

You may harass the author about these or other matters via [Twitter][twitter].

[^fn1]: In 2008.

[^fn2]: Do not do this.

[^fn3]: The site will also honour [DNT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) browser headers.
