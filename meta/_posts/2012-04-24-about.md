So, what on earth is going on?  This is an experiment in serialised prose fiction, more like an ongoing, open-ended and regularly-updated webcomic than a traditional serial with a predefined scope and conclusion.  Updates currently come twice-weekly on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

The [story][1] is a mystery, its genre is [slipstream][2], and it is written in the second person. These may be reasons enough to stop reading.

You may harass the author about these or other matters via [Twitter][3].
