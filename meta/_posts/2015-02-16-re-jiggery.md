Time for a bit of a spring clean.

This site was [always intended](/meta/about/) as a platform for experimentation in whatever took my fancy. Originally that was purely short prose fiction but now I'll be expanding to non-fiction topics too, starting with topics related to the site's construction and the workflows which feed it.

The first short series will cover the mechanics of the most recent site redesign and the reasons for it---trying to find a better, lower-friction approach to getting content on the site using my normal writing toolset---and we'll see what happens from there.
