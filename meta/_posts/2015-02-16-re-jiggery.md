Time for a bit of a spring clean.

This site was [always intended](/meta/about/) as a platform for experimentation in... well, in whatever took my fancy. Originally that was limited to short pieces of prose fiction but I'm also interested in the mechanics of writing, especially from the perspective of a software developer. I think the combination of those traditionally quite distinct worlds[^fn1] is interesting in itself.

I'm therefore going to begin a short series related to the site's construction and the workflows which feed it. I want to cover the mechanics of the most recent site redesign and the reasons behind it; to spend some time finding a better, lower-friction approach to getting content onto the site and using both my writing and tech toolsets to do so.

Stay tuned.

[^fn1]: Although increasingly commonplace---any web writer needs to be a technologist to some extent.
