Time for a bit of a spring clean.

This site was [always intended](/meta/about/) as a platform for experimentation in... well, in whatever took my fancy. Originally that was limited to short pieces of prose fiction but I'm also interested in the mechanics of writing, both fiction and non-fiction, especially from the perspective of a software developer. I think the combination of those normally fairly distinct worlds[^fn1] is interesting in itself.

So next-up I'm going to write a short series related to the site's construction and the workflows which feed it. I want to cover the mechanics of the most recent site redesign and the reasons behind it; to spend some time finding better and lower-friction approaches to getting content onto the site, using both my writing and tech toolsets to do so.

Stay tuned.

[^fn1]: Is that even true anymore?---any web writer needs to be a technologist to some extent.
