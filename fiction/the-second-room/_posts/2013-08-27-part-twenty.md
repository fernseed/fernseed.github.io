You need to shift your weight, it is too painful to continue to lie on those parts of yourself that you have so abused to get here.  You attempt a roll: your shoulders and the muscles of your upper back are fatigued, so instead you slide your elbow, your right-hand elbow---perhaps you are right-handed?---upwards a little, in the direction of your head, until your head and torso begin naturally to tilt to the left.  The pain is significantly greater in this interim position; your upper arm trembles with spasms that appear to require no deliberate effort on your part.  You bear the pain and increase the angle and stress untill the tremor becomes a shimmy, the shimmy a full palsy.  You pull leftwards with your head, fail and rock back.  You pull leftwards with your head, fail and rock back.  You pull leftwards with your head until your upper torso twists enough, your arms splayed, to bring your forehead into contact with the wood of the floor, fighting the pounding blood of the onset of unconsciousness and keeping yourself awake.

Your current state: legs largely flat on their backs on the floor, external to this nook.  Hips tilted slightly, hitching the curtain up further, leaving a gap towards your right hand side.  No additional or new light comes from the room beyond, the increasing darkness has normalised the two locations.  Your torso is twisted at the abdomen, lying partly on top of your left arm, your right arm cocked out to the right.  Your forehead touches floor, but does not rest there, this is not a resting position.  The particular combination of muscles used is painful, but functional.  You hold yourself there and delight in the small control, despite the discomfort.

You wait until the next set of trembling begins, this time in your lower buttock, the leftmost, and in the long-muscles, what muscle you have, which hold your sides together.  You let them grow to shimmy, wondering if it is possible to experience cramping of the buttock or side-torso, and groan yourself in sheets of sweat onto enough of your front that you can remain there without further exertion.

Your current state: the disposition of your legs is unknown, one is clearly on top of the other, but you have lost track.  Your face is left-cheeked on the floor, most of your front upper-mass resting likewise. Your left arm is wholly underneath you, your right forearm resting in the small of your back.  It will do, it does not currently hurt, although you know that it will not last.  Gather your strength, move again later when you must, however much later that might be.  What have you learned?

The floor looks rougher than it feels.

You are so acclimatised to lying on your back that your head swims when you change orientation.

There appears to be a gap in the boxes which had been behind you, which still are, but that you now consider directly ahead, more or less.  You believe that if you could shuffle or crawl yourself into that hollow then only your feet would be protuding back out into the room.  There would be boxes above you which, while having the possibility of crushing failure, would also provide some sense of security from any attack from above.
