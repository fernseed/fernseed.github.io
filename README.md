## Meta
So, what on earth is going on? [fernseed.org](http://fernseed.org) began as a dumping ground; somewhere for me to practice the process of writing by web-publishing short stories. The URL would be known to no-one but myself and the domain name was [a bit of a pun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fern#Folklore). 

It was eventually repurposed as a single ongoing experiment in serialised prose fiction with [*The Second Room*](https://github.com/fernseed/fernseed.github.io/tree/master/fiction/the-second-room/_posts), a semi-regularly updated second-person mystery in the [slipstream](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slipstream_(genre)) genre.

More recently, the site has expanded to also encompass thoughts on technology, the process of writing and other randomness.

## Technology
Updates are written in *Scrivener* using the *Markdown* plain-text syntax and automatically converted to HTML by the *Jekyll* static-website generation tool. Since 2014 all content has been version controlled using *git* and hosted by *GitHub Pages*. This means that you'll be able to access the complete [source code](https://github.com/fernseed/fernseed.github.io) for the site along with its [change history](https://github.com/fernseed/fernseed.github.io/commits/master), if you so desire. See the [acknowledgements page](http://fernseed.org/meta/acknowledgements/) for a full list of the tools and technology in use.
