### Meta

So, what on earth is going on?  This is an experiment in serialised prose fiction, more like an ongoing, open-ended and regularly-updated webcomic than a traditional serial with a predefined scope and conclusion.  Updates currently come weekly, published at midnight each Sunday (GMT).

The [story][archives] is a second-person mystery loosely falling within the [slipstream][genre] genre.

### Technology

Each [update][posts] is written in the [Markdown][markdown] plain text syntax, converted into HTML by [Jekyll][jekyll]. Hosting is by [GitHub Pages][github] which also provides access to the complete [source code][source] for the site along with its [update history][commits].

Cookies are used for anonymous [analytics][google] purposes only and you may choose to [opt out][cookies] of their collection.

You may harass the author about these or other matters via [Twitter][twitter].
